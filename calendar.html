        <h1>I spent the past four years documenting my life in Google Calendar</h1>
        <p>A question commonly asked when catching up with someone is “what have you been up to
          recently?” and unfortunately I find that most people, myself included, have a difficult
          time consolidating their “recent” into a cohesive answer. Very often someone will only
          mention one or two substantial life events, sometimes nothing at all and you get hit
          with an MJ shrug. </p>
