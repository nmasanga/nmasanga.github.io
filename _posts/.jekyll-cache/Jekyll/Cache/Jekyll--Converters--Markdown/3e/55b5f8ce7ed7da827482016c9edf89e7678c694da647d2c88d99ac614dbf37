<p>When catching up with someone, itâ€™s very commons to ask â€œwhat have you been up to recently?â€. Unfortunately I find that most people, myself included, have a difficult time consolidating their â€œrecentâ€ into a cohesive answer. Typically someone will only mention one or two substantial life events, sometimes nothing at all and you get hit with an MJ shrug.</p>

<p>I started to realize that I struggled remembering moments in my life. Maybe this can be attributed to our current environment: weâ€™re overstimulated with never-ending content, notifications, distractions, the need for efficiency, social pressures, and the like. Of course, I remember the big moments â€” my first kiss, receiving my university acceptance email, having my first ever panic attack after a calculus final, job interviews where I went to the wrong location (yes, this actually happened to me) â€” because itâ€™s easy to remember the amazing moments, as well as the terrible ones. But what about the moments in between? The moments that are still good or bad but not *that *memorable. Itâ€™s impossible to remember everything but at the very minimum I wanted to have a general sense of what any given day of my life looked like.</p>

<p>Additionally, I wanted it to feel like my days really counted for something, that I didnâ€™t just completely waste it. Especially for the days where nothing noteworthy happened; I still <em>did</em> things but having no recollection of what I did on a given day was, to me, equivalent to that time never occurring. Figuratively speaking of course; time *is *constant.</p>

<p>My solution was simple: Iâ€™m going to write events in my Google calendar <em>after</em> they happen. Retroactively.</p>

<p>Essentially, my calendar was going to be a lighter version of a diary. I canâ€™t tell you how I came to this solution but it made sense since itâ€™s relatively easy to sync your Google calendar with other apps and devices. Plus Iâ€™ve already succumbed to Big Brother errrrâ€¦ I mean Google, with all their apps I use. Why not a little more detail about my life?</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*A5DXZmMP5ND3usFuM2vE6g.png" alt="My first calendar log" /><em>My first calendar log</em></p>

<p>This was on June 19, 2016, Fatherâ€™s Day. I didnâ€™t log anything before these events and I have no recollection of what happened. It was a Sunday so I definitely went to church, we probably had an after church potluck for Fatherâ€™s Day lunch, as is tradition, duh. But these are just assumptions, mentally I canâ€™t *confirm *it. I canâ€™t bring images to my head.</p>

<p>Looking at the bright side, and the main reason I started doing this, is that I can vividly remember the events that I did write down. My oldest sister, Melissa, who lives in Calgary, was in town to shoot an engagement set with my other sister Noelle (theyâ€™re<a href="https://easephoto.ca/"> professional wedding photographers</a>). Their shoot was at the University of Torontoâ€™s campus and my sisters wanted to grab dinner after so I killed time at Robarts library. I grabbed coffee at Lâ€™espresso. After the shoot we went to La Carnita; please do yourself a favour and get their Mexican corn.</p>

<p>After dinner I headed back home and watched Lebron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers defeat the Golden State Warriors in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA finals (a friendly reminder that Golden State blew a 3â€“1 lead).</p>

<p>This was almost 4 years ago and I can still pull images from this day into my head. I even remember getting iced coffee at McDonaldâ€™s during the drive back home â€” an event I didnâ€™t log. These werenâ€™t astronomical events in my life (no offense to my sisters, love you!). I picked up an americano, went to the library, got tacos, and watched a basketball game; things that I could do on any given day, things that might not necessarily come up when someone asks â€œwhat have you been up to recently?â€. Nor are they events that one would make pre-scheduled calendar entires for. But I still havenâ€™t lost these memories; they arenâ€™t dormant in the depths of my mind and need some trigger to recollect them, theyâ€™re readily retrievable with a quick tap of my calendar app.</p>

<h2 id="mundane-to-memorable">Mundane to Memorable</h2>

<p>As I went along with this exercise, I started to notice that I was lacking substance with the more habitual events of my life.</p>

<p>If I had a funny conversation with a co-worker or a meal that day was phenomenal, anything that broke the norm for the day, I would write it down in an effort to turn that seemingly very average day into something a little more memorable.</p>

<p>When you have a set schedule, whether it be work or school or other commitments youâ€™ve made, a lot of the days can start to just blend together. Days get repetitive, itâ€™s hard to differentiate what you did at work from one day to the next. Seeing a blank or regularly scheduled slate deterred me a bit, it felt I was just going through the motions.</p>

<p>An additional goal of mine was to make the days that blended together a little more distinguishable by adding smaller events that stook out to me. If I had a funny conversation with a co-worker or a meal that day was phenomenal, anything that broke the norm for the day, I would write it down in an effort to turn that seemingly very average day into something a little more memorable.</p>

<p>That being said, I didnâ€™t find it necessary to remember all the minute details of my day-to-day routines, that wouldâ€™ve been a little *too *excessive â€” as if this exercise wasnâ€™t excessive enough. Obviously itâ€™s more important to have a holistic understanding of the lessons you take away from life experiences, and I definitely earned that without having to journal every fine detail. To clarify, I wouldnâ€™t write a Murakami-esque recollection of the scene, just a small footnote in the description of the calendar entry.</p>

<p>Even non-work, non-school regularly scheduled events in my life â€” basketball games, volleyball games, bible study â€” were hard to distinguish. It wasnâ€™t enough for me to just put â€œvolleyballâ€ in my calendar. I started writing notes about what the final outcome was, who we were playing, how our team felt. Whatever I could to have that event stick out a little more to me.</p>

<p>I started to realize that these footnotes became indispensable. Spending the extra few seconds to jot down granular details added a lot of substance during my reflections and has its practical uses too. I had a friend ask me about recommendations for their trip to Boston so I pulled out my calendar and searched â€œbostonâ€. An event from August 2016, a few months after I started this exercise, popped up called â€œBoston Day 1â€ which has the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Started trip, drove for 6 hours straight, got to Joeâ€™s, went to Clover got Zucchini, chilled at Harvard, MIT, Darwin coffee, Tosconni ice cream, chilled by Charles River, chilled at Joeâ€™s, Redbones for dinner got baby back ribs, went to Kung fu tea got matcha bubble tea</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A little obsessive, I know. Conversely, this took around a minute to write before I went to sleep that same day and to me it was worth the little time and effort. This was 4 years ago, realistically I couldnâ€™t have remembered any of these places on my own but after a quick search on the Google Calendar web app, I got a somewhat detailed look at my first day in Boston and a rush of memories from that time.</p>

<h2 id="make-your-free-time-count">Make your free time count</h2>

<p>This exercise also forces me to look forward into my life and be really intentional with my calendar and inherently, my time. When retroactively filling in my calendar, I have that vantage point of my past few days which simultaneously helps me evaluate how I want to spend my upcoming days.</p>

<p>Speaking of productivity, I really didnâ€™t want this to tool to be a â€œproductivity hackâ€ or to use it to â€œoptimize my timeâ€. If anything, one could say that this is the opposite of optimal. Why look back so intently when that time could be used looking forward? Of course, everyone has their own definition of â€œoptimal.â€ For me, that sometimes means bettering myself in some way, working on a â€œside projectâ€ (gross), expanding my skills in a hobby, or filling the time with people by going out to concerts, restaurants or other activities a Toronto-based 20-something would partake in that are considered Instagram-able.</p>

<p>Looking back on the days where I did absolutely none of that, it still felt rewarding because I have a footnote of what the nothing consisted of. My day didnâ€™t feel completely wasted. Maybe itâ€™s my inner completionist but seeing a calendar with an event titled â€œjust chilledâ€ with a few notes brought me more satisfaction than having a completely blank slate. Plus, it reassured me that I didnâ€™t have to do something â€œproductiveâ€ every day to have a life that felt full.</p>

<h2 id="blank-days-happen">Blank days happen</h2>

<p>Needless to say, I do get lazy with this â€” missing events, skimping on the details, repetitive events with no distinguishable features. Whole days where I would go to work, come home, do little to nothing, and not have a modicum of proof for the events of that day. Sometimes I wonâ€™t backfill my calendar for a whole week and will need to spend a painstaking amount of time searching the depths of my brain to recover any images that spark my memories.</p>

<p>I have a few days where the only event is â€œvolleyballâ€ but nothing else recorded, not even any notes in the event description. Nothing about those days sticks out to me and it does make me a little sad but I donâ€™t dwell on it too much, again, I canâ€™t remember everything.</p>

<p>Have you ever had those conversations with your friends where youâ€™re all reminiscing on the past, someone will bring up a memory and then everyone starts adding more and more details? This is what my calendar feels like. I might not have all the details to any given day but seeing the events gets the momentum rolling in my brain to uncover more information about that time and helps paints a bigger picture about which stage in life I was in.</p>

<p>My Google Calendar isnâ€™t the panacea to my terrible memory, and I never intended for it to be, but thereâ€™s so much more I wish I could remember. Iâ€™m trying my best to keep memories alive and there are other platforms that help. The intent behind the 1 Second Everyday app is wonderful and adds an extra visual layer to my memory journey. I try to take a lot of photos which I back up in Google Photos since it offers unlimited storage.</p>

<p>There are no hard and fast rules to all this, Iâ€™ve changed my approach to recording these details in my calendar many times. But the end result is the same: I want to have a recollection of my life and I want to make it feel like no days have gone wasted. The experiences Iâ€™ve lived, the information Iâ€™m absorbing, the people I spend time with, the highlights, lowlights, and everything in between; I hope that these memories paint the picture of a life worth living, one that I hope to be proud of when itâ€™s all said and done.</p>

<p>So the next time someone asks me â€œwhat have you been up to, Norm?â€ I can give the most detailed, long-winded answer ever. Count your blessings.</p>
