I"Ñ<p>Yo!</p>

<p>If for some reason you have exerted cognitive energy going through my site, instead of on the never ending stream of content available in our shared ethereal ethos, then big ups! I appreciate your time.</p>

<p>Things are pretty bare bones right now but just like Kanye‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Life of Pablo‚Äù album, this is an iterative process. Perfect is the enemy of great (not to imply that this site will be great) so I hope that you bare with me as I continue to learn more front-end dev things and expand this site.</p>

<p>Despite having a pretty fruitful life so far, I realized that I haven‚Äôt produced many ‚Äútangible‚Äù things. As a statistician by trade, all I have to show for it is a piece of paper and some bullet points on a resum√©. So moving forward I want to have my work and thoughts put into a more consumable form and to have all of it live in one space.</p>

<p>Growing up I wanted to be a sports journalist and I got to live that out a little when I was the Sports Editor of my university newspaper, <em>Imprint</em>. I really haven‚Äôt written since but I want to get back into it with a blog and more thought out longform pieces.</p>

<p>When I was 15 (so back in 2010), I told my Uncle Syd that I wanted to go into sports media and he told me two things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn about sport analytics cus that will be the future</li>
  <li>Read Outlier by Malcolm Gladwell</li>
</ul>

<p>And I genuinely think that if it weren‚Äôt for these two nuggets of wisdom, I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am today.</p>

<p>To my current or future potential employers, uhhh I hope this is more of a positive reflection of my character rather than an interpretation of my skills (or lack thereof).</p>

<p>If you actually made it this far, what the heck, go do something better with your time. Read a book or grab coffee with that one person you‚Äôve been meaning to hit up.</p>

<p>Take care.</p>
