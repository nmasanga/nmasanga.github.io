I"≥<p>yo!</p>

<p>if for some reason you have exerted cognitive energy going through my site, instead of on the infinite stream of content available in this shared ethereal ethos, then big ups! i appreciate your time.</p>

<p>things are pretty bare bones right now but just like Kanye‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Life of Pablo‚Äù album, this is an iterative process and i wanted to put something out there. ‚Äúperfect is the enemy of great‚Äù (not to imply that this site will be great) so I hope that you bare with me as I continue to learn more front-end dev things and expand this site.</p>

<p>despite having a pretty fruitful life so far, i realized that i haven‚Äôt produced many ‚Äútangible‚Äù things. as a statistician by trade, all i have to show for it is a piece of paper and some bullet points on a resum√©. so moving forward i want to have my work and thoughts put into a more consumable form and to have all of it live in one space.</p>

<p>growing up i wanted to be a writer so i‚Äôm trying to make 15 year-old norm proud by starting a blog. my sisters are photographers which inspired me to become a person that takes photos as a hobby (I don‚Äôt call myself a photographer, I don‚Äôt have the right to say that).</p>

<p>i also have some random ass ideas and maybe one day i will have the motivation to bring them to life.</p>

<p>to my current or future potential employers, uhhh i hope this is more of a positive reflection of my character rather than an interpretation of my skills (or lack thereof).</p>

<p>if you actually made it this far, what the heck, go do something better with your time. read a book or grab coffee with that one person you‚Äôve been meaning to hit up.</p>

<p>take care.</p>
